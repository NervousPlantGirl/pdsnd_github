### Udacity - Learn Python - Project 3
Basic Data Exploration on Bikeshare Data

### Project Description
While working on the Udacity Python foundation course in Project 3, they require that I make sense of the bike sharing data provided and then post my work on GitHub

### Program Description
The program takes user input for the city, month, and day for which the user wants to view data.
Upon receiving the user input, the program will ask and answer the following details:
- Most popular times of travel
- Most common month for travel
- Most common day of week for travel
- Most common hour for travel
- Most popular stations and trips
- Most common start station
- Most common end station
- Most common trip from start to end
- Total travel time
- Average travel time
- Number of users by gender
- Most common birth year
- The oldest user
- The youngest user
- Raw data

Finally, the user is prompted with the choice of restarting the program or not.
